Assignment Description:
In this assignment, your group will select an imperative OR a functional OR a domain-specific, special-purpose programming language and explore the context, motivation, and design rationale behind its creation. Once a group chooses a PL, other groups cannot choose the same PL. (We will use comments to ensure this.) You will investigate why this language was developed, what kind of problems or domains it was meant to solve, and what makes it ideal for specific types of programs or projects.

You are expected to:

Research the origins of your chosen programming language. When and why it was needed in the first place? Which previous languages influenced its design, etc.

Identify the main goals and design philosophy of the language.

Describe the target domain(s) or problem types for which the language excels (e.g., systems programming, web development, data analysis, embedded systems, etc.).

Support your claims with examples, such as real-world systems, companies, or projects that effectively use this language.

Create a slide presentation that clearly presents this information.

Record a video in which your team explains the content of your slides as if you are presenting to an audience.

Note: AI can be used to have a general understanding of the language, example generation, etc. But the final presentation has to be human generated, containing your own findings, thoughts, etc. about the language. Your presentation and your video must exhibit a good composition with a meaningful flow of ideas.
